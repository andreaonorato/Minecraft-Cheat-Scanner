# Minecraft-Cheat-Scanner

This tool is coded in C language, I chose this language due to its speed for small operations.
It contains different strings of the most famous ghost clients and injection clients for Minecraft.
It can detect many clients very quickly.
It works only in the Windows operating system.

HOW DOES IT WORK:

1) Download Process Hacker 2 (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)
2) Install it and open it
3) Right-click on Javaw.exe ---> Proprieties ---> Memory ---> take off the "v" on "Hide free regions"
4) On the same pages go to "strings...", type 4 near "Minimum" and place a tick on "Image" and "Mapped" and confirm "OK"
5) Go to "Save..." and save the file in the same directory as this compiled C file ("String Scanner.exe")
6) Open "String Scanner.exe" and It will pop up a black screen with the name of the client found.

Hope It will work well for you, if not contact me here or @andre_ono on Telegram.
