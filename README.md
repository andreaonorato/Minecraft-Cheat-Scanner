# Minecraft-Cheat-Scanner

Thanks for downloading it!!!

This tool is coded in C language.
It contains different strings of the most famous ghost client and injection clients for Minecraft.
It can detect many clients very quicly and it works only in Windows operative system

HOW DOES IT WORKS:

1) Downlaod Process Hacker 2 (https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/)
2) Install it and open it
3) Right click on Javaw.exe ---> Proprieties ---> Memory ---> take off the "v" on "Hide free regions"
4) In the same pages go to "strings...", write 4 near Minimum and place a tick on "Image" and "Mapped" and confirm "OK"
5) Go to "Save..." and save the file in the same directory as this file ("String Scanner.exe")
6) Open "String Scanner.exe" and It will give you the output with the name of the client found.

Hope It will work well, if not contact me here.
